This is a manpower analysis that deals with the projection of future trainees available to commit to taskings. The CSV is sensitive so it was not loaded.

There is also an awards comparable that compares the amount of time for awards to be processed from Battalion and Group. This is to see if there is a requirement for policy change; however, the csv is also sensitive in nature.

The purpose of these two scripts was to create visualizations of data overtime, identify outliers, and eventually anticipate future manpower actions based on time of year.
